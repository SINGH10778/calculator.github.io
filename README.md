# calculator.github.io
Description:
This program creates a simple calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the tkinter library. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator features:

A display area for showing the current input or result.
Numeric buttons (0-9) and operator buttons (+, -, *, /).
A button for clearing the input (C).
A button for evaluating the expression (=).
The calculator evaluates the mathematical expression input by the user and shows the result. The program handles errors (e.g., division by zero) by displaying an "Error" message.

Instructions:
Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

Save the Script: Save the following code into a Python file, for example calculator.py.

Run the Script:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
Run the script by typing:
bash
Copy code
python calculator.py
Use the Calculator:

The calculator window will open.
Click the numeric buttons (0-9) to input numbers.
Click the operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform the corresponding arithmetic operations.
Press the = button to evaluate the current expression.
Use the C button to clear the display if needed.

Requirements:
Python Version: 3.x (any version of Python 3 should work fine).

Libraries:

tkinter: This is the standard library in Python used for creating GUI applications. It is included in the default Python installation, so no additional installation is required for most systems.
Operating System: This script should work on any operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) that supports Python and Tkinter.

Installation of Required Libraries:
If for some reason, tkinter is not installed in your Python environment, you can install it by following these steps:

Windows: Tkinter is usually installed with Python. If it's not, you may need to reinstall Python and ensure that the tkinter checkbox is selected during installation.

macOS: Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python.

Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): To install Tkinter, you can use the following command:

sudo apt-get install python3-tk
